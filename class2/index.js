// Types of naming conventions
Camel Case
Camel case is a variable naming convention used almost everywhere during variable naming where words in a phrase are combined without spaces.

In camel case, the first letter of each word in a phrase is capitalized except for the first word, which starts with lowercase. There are no spaces between the words.


Pascal Case
Pascal case is another naming convention we use frequently to combine the words in a phrase without using spaces. It is similar to the 'Camel Case' convention just with a slight difference.

In this naming convention each word in a phrase is capitalized including the first word.


Snake Case
Another very famous variable naming convention is 'Snake Case' convention. This naming convention is most preferred in programming languages like Python.

In snake case, all the words of a phrase are written in lowercase and separated by underscores("_") instead of spaces.


Kebab Case
The kebab case is almost similar to the snake case where all the words in a phrase are written in lowercase.

The only difference between snake case and kebab case naming convention is, In kebab case the words in a phrase are separated by hyphens("-").
